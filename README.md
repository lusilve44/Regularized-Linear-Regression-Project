# Regularized linear regression proyect

Using the following datset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/regularized-linear-regression-project-tutorial/main/dataset.csv) we are going to apply the LASSO model (which already includes feature selection) to obtain the most important features that influence in your target variable. Also we implement the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to choose the parameters that minimize the error of a linear function.
